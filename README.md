## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program

### Overview

This is the second project of Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree.
The goal of the project is to build a Deep Neural Network model that can identify the traffic signs with high accuracy. I used several layers including Convolutional layers, ReLU, Dropout, and so on. As a result, I got **90%** accuracy for the test data.
