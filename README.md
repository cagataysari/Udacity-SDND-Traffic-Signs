## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program

### Overview

This is the second project of Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree.
The goal of the project is to build a Deep Neural Network model that can identify the traffic signs with high accuracy. I used several layers including Convolutional layers, ReLU, Dropout, and so on. As a result, I got **90%** accuracy for the test data.

#### Updates on the 2nd Submission

I added 7 more captured images at the last section. And I realized that in the previous submission, when I tested the model on the captured images, I forgot to normalize the images. So I normalized the test images this time and I got better results than before.

Furthermore, I compared the performance of the model on the dataset and on the captured images, and I included more discussion regarding the certainty and uncertainty of the predictions of the model on the captured images.
